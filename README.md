# PokemonGame
While learning Java OOP I decided to make a game to track my progress with the OOP knowledge. It creates two Pokémons it requires action from the user of the program and depending on the choice the Pokémons are either attacking, healing, defending, or surrender. When either of the Pokemons runs out of health the other one wins and the program is giving you an option to either terminate it or to start new battle. I will update this repository weekly.
